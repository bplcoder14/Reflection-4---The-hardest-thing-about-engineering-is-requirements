### Rudderless
After reading through the article linked above I have chosen the work rudderless. This is because stakeholders are rudderless(and it sounds smart). Rudderless means lacking a clear sense of one's aims or principles(according to a quick google search). It is important to find what the stakeholders want so that they are satisfied with the work done by engineers. However, they struggle to articulate(oooo fancy word) what is it that they want/need. This makes figuring out the requirements for a project the most important part.

sorry for all the notes in (). im tired and its the only thing keeping me sane.
